<h1>HabitAPI</h1>

I love to track habits, so I wanted to practice creating a Habit API.
The idea is to be able to set your habits, and send updates to the API in order to track progress.

Right now Im using Node (Express) and MongoDB.
In the future I would like to add a front-end part in order to be able to visualize the progress of habits,
being able to filter by habit, or by date. Also being able to check the quantity of some habits like reading or studying (how many pages/hours, etc.).
